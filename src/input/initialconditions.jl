    Domain(IC, T, P, time_update=0u"Myr")

Return a struct containing the struct `IC`, the PT conditions `T` and `P`  and the nondimensionalised parameters of the problem. `time_update` can be used to update the PT conditions during the simulation. If so, `T` and `P` have to be of the same size as `time_update` and correspond to the values of PT to update to.
